ARTICLE                 INFO                              ABSTRACT

Keywords:                                                 In the past two decades, there has been a rapid development in the drone industry known as Unmanned
Cyber security and privacy                                Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Currently, the use of commercial UAVs has increased a lot due to their affordability,
Vulnerabilities                                           but lack of security implementations has introduced many threats and vulnerabilities in UAVs. In addition,

                                                          and security issues of UAVs by dividing them into three classes: Software, Hardware and Communication.
                                                          Particularly, for each class, we systematically survey the common vulnerabilities causing potential attacks
                                                          to UAVs. Secondly, a review of prevailing threats that are threatening civilian UAVs’ applications is also
                                                          a part of this survey. Thirdly, a comprehensive discussion of passive and active attacks from adversaries,

                                                          of existing mitigation techniques and countermeasures, to protect UAVs. Fifthly, the solution architecture
                                                          part includes discussion about emerging technologies such as, blockchain usage, machine learning, intrusion

                                                          highlighted the lessons learned about security and privacy of UAVs are also summarized. Lastly, the survey
                                                          is concluded by discussing important pitfalls as well as suggestions for future research directions, concerning
                                                          privacy and security of UAVs.

UAV. In more than one backbone UAV architecture, backbone UAVs
and GCS of every swarm are especially critical to the success of mission.
   Although, the backbone UAV gets compromised but mission might
be completed. It can be observed from Fig. 9, that attackers must
compromise the GCS or four backbone UAVs for disrupting complete
UAVs network. Further, advanced architecture of UAVs network is by
mixing UAVs, as shown in Fig. 10. In this architecture, securing the
network of backbone UAV is equally important as the whole network
security, because the threats are prone to increase of complexity and
number of UAVs.
   Additionally, the UAV protocols for routing are vulnerable because
of limited resources, dynamic topology, and lack of encryption in
wireless links (Maxa et al., 2017). In such situations, attackers take
advantage of such constraints for performing numerous routing attacks
at network level. The attacker may disclose sensitive data in UAV
network which does not have security mechanisms.
    Adversaries can leak routing and topology information as well as
UAV location by using eavesdropping techniques (Maxa et al., 2017).
                                                                                                             Fig. 9. Swarm of UAVs in a decentralized architecture.
Therefore, without considering authentication and integrity, routing
protocols of UAVs are prone to attacks, like route-cache poisoning (Wu
et al., 2007), where the attackers add incorrect routing information into
UAV cache.
